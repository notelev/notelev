### About Me

<!--
**notelev/notelev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->

- Primarily using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) & [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- I’m currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) *for fun*
- In love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
- As you might already have noticed I'm Moroccan.
- Just incase you wanna know my OG nickname, It is *X*.

*Sorry there isn't much to see here, most of my projects are closed and untested source*
